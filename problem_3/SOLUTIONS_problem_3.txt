- When finding the square root, use math.sqrt instead of **0.5, it is much faster. NumPy and Math are both optimised for faster mathematical computations than the inbuilt functions.

- Because Python is an interpreted language, the fewer instructions that must be executed, the faster the code will run. So, generally, using a for loop will be faster than a while loop (list comprehensions are even faster, if they can be used)
	- If you change to for loops and want to have an additional variable that is 'counting' eaach loop, then use the enumerate function for greater performance

- When assigning variables, doing many at the same time is much faster. E.g.

apple = 1
banana = 2

Change to:

apple, banana = 1,2
